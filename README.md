# Arbitrary PPI Calculator

As the title says, this is a completely abritrary PPI calculator for my T-shirt printing purposes. I just needed a calculator to check if the print PPI was ok based on the print size (A paper sizes; A2, A3, A4). It is arbitrary because I'm using fixed diagonal lenghts for the prints, so it's easier for me to do the math quickly. I read somewhere that a PPI between 200 and 300 is good enough.

### Q&A

- Q: Why did you use Bootstrap? A: Yes.
- Q: Why are you using A sizes? A: Because they are the baselines for the only DTG printer that I could find locally with the print sizes that I wanted.

#### Some size references for personal use:

- A2: 16.5 x 23.4 in (42 x 59.4 cm) / Diam: 28.63 in (72.75 cm)
- A3: 11.7 x 16.5 in (29.7 x 42 cm) / Diam: 20.23 in (51.44 cm)
- A4: 8.3 x 11.7 in (21 x 29.7 cm) / Diam: 14.35 in (36.37 cm)

For an A2-sized print canvas, I used a 7200 x 5000px last time but I think it was too much, I guess. Dunno what canvas size I would use for an A3.
